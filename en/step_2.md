## Your idea

Use this step to plan your book. You can plan by just thinking; adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch; drawing or writing; or however you like! 

### Why are you making the book?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your book. 

It could be:
- To entertain a younger child,
- To share an important message such as encouraging recycling,
- To teach someone how to do something such as make your favourite food, 
- To tell or retell a story,
- To share something about yourself,
- To express yourself and be creative.

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your book for (your **audience**).

It could be for a friend, a family member, a school class, people who share a hobby, fans of a musician, or just for yourself.

Now it's time to start thinking about the pages (backdrops) and the characters and objects (sprites) in your book.

--- task ---

Open a new Scratch project on your Raspberry Pi.

Use your new Scratch project, a pen and paper, or both to plan ideas for your book.

--- task ---

Think about the backdrops and sprites:
- Which backdrops or background colours will you use in your book? 
- How will users interact with your book to turn to the next page?
- Which characters and objects will you have in your book? 
- How will the the sprites be animated and interact on each page?
