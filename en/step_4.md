## Make your pages

Once you have the story and interactions for your book, you'll need to make the pages.

--- task ---
Decide how many pages you will need for your electronic book. 

You might have one per backdrop, or just a cover and a single inside page with multiple buttons.
--- /task ---

Each page needs to have a back and a front made of cardboard, with internal contacts made from aluminium foil - like a sandwich.

--- task ---
Gather or cut the needed amount of cardboard for your book's pages.

If you are using cardboard, you will need to get a back and a front piece cut out for each page you need. If you are using manila folders (or similar items) you can use one per page by simply gluing the foil inside.

Each page needs to have a simple  design on the front side which relates to what is happening in your book. These designs will be cut out of each page, re-covered with foil and connected to he Raspberry Pi's GP pins to create buttons for your reader to interact with.

--- task ---
Draw the designs you want to have on each page. Keep them fairly simple, as more complex shapes may not work well. You can search online for 'stencil' images to see some good examples.

--- task ---
Once you have drawn all the designs you need on the front side of each page, cut them out using a craft knife or scissors. Make sure you get permission from an adult to use sharp tools.

Take your F-F jumper cables and remove one of the ends by pulling it using a little force. We want to try and expose the internal core of the wire.
