## Make your pages

Once you have the story and interactions for your book, you'll need to make the pages.

--- task ---
Decide how many pages you will need for your electronic book. 

You might have one per backdrop, or just a cover and a single inside page with multiple buttons.
--- /task ---

Each page needs to have a back and a front made of cardboard, with internal contacts made from aluminium foil - like a sandwich.

If you are using cardboard, you will need to get a back and a front piece cut out for each page you need. If you are using manila folders (or similar items) you can use one per page by gluing the foil inside.
