## Make your pages

Once you have the story and interactions for your book, you'll need to make the pages.

--- task ---
Decide how many pages you will need for your electronic book. 

You might have one per backdrop, or just a cover and a single inside page with multiple buttons.
--- /task ---

Each page needs to have a back and a front made of cardboard, with internal contacts made from aluminium foil - like a sandwich.

--- task ---
Gather or cut the needed amount of cardboard for your book's pages.

If you are using cardboard, you will need to get a back and a front piece cut out for each page you need. If you are using manila folders (or similar items) you can use one per page by simply gluing the foil inside.
--- /task ---

Each page needs to have a simple  design on the front side which relates to what is happening in your book. These designs will be cut out of each page, and filled with foil for buttons.

--- task ---
Draw the designs you want to have on each page. Keep them fairly simple, as more complex shapes may not work well. You can search online for 'stencil' images to see some good examples.
