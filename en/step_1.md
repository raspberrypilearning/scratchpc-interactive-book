## Introduction

You are going to create an 'electronic book' in Scratch based on your own original idea. Your book will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will:
+ Think of original design ideas to create an interactive electronic book,
+ Choose which skills to use to make your idea,
+ Fabricate a physical book with conductive pages and an activation device,
+ Connect it to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins
+ Code the interactive story (You can use your book from the Scratch 1 pathway, if you have completed it!)
+ Show your friends and family!

### What you will need
To make an electronic book, you will need:
 + A Raspberry Pi
 + F-F Jumper cables
 + Thin cardboard (manila folders or cereal boxes are perfect!)
 + Aluminium foil
 + Glue
 + Strong tape
 + Scissors or craft knife (get an adult's permission to use sharp tools!)

### PROJECT BRIEF: Electronic book
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

You need to create an **electronic book**. Your book could be a story, a tutorial, a fact book, an interactive book... or something else!

Your book should:
+ Have multiple pages with a way to turn to the next page,
+ Have at least one sprite,
+ Have interactive features on each page,
+ Say or do something different with every page,
+ Have speech or sound effects.


Your book could:
+ Have changing backdrops for each page,
+ Have text or art created in the paint editor,
+ Have multiple 'buttons' on each page.
