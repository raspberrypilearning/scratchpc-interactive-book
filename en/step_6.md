## Upgrade your project
If you have time, you can upgrade your project by adding more detail or flair! 

You might already have some ideas for things to improve your book, but if not we have some ideas for you!

You could:
+ Add a cover page with cool artwork
+ Make another page
+ Add more code to your sprites
+ Add another sprite
+ Record a sound to use in the project
+ Use the text-to-speech extension to have your book read aloud 
+ Colour and decorate your pages and interaction device
+ Upgrade your book with better and more durable materials

Self-reading book:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSl8d8gB0FM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This example uses the `Text-to-speech`{:class="block3extensions"} extension in Scratch to read out written text. The stories are from 'public domain' stories (that means they aren't owned by anyone) and simply pasted in from a text file.

You can see that the user chooses the story at the beginning of the program using a contact, which changes the backdrop and sets the different story that will be read by Scratch.
