## Build and test

Now it's time to make your book. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time.

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It's much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

You will need to decide what order to build your book. To get started, you could:
- Create all the pages as backdrops, or
- Get one page working first
--- /task ---

You may not have time to add everything you want to your book. That's okay, you can always come back to it later.

**Test:** Show someone else your project and get their feedback. Do you want make any changes to your book?

**Debug:**

You might find some bugs in your code that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs:

--- collapse ---

---
title: My sprites is showing or hiding on the wrong pages
---

Check that the sprite has `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"} scripts with `show`{:class="block3looks"} or `hide`{:class="block3looks"} as needed. Check that you have chosen the correct backdrop name `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"}. It helps to give backdrops good names to help spot problems like this.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: My sprite is going upside down
---

Add a `set rotation style left-right`{:class="block3motion"} or `set rotation style don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} block.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: My sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces
---

Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor).

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: My sound does not play
---

Have you added a block to `play sound`{:class="block3sound"} when the sprite is clicked? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite from the **Sounds** tab. Check the volume on your computer and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code â€” try `set volume to`{:class="block3sound"}`100`.
